# Fred-Marli-DAP2

## Collaborators
- although the title may suggest something different possibly more than two people are working on the project

## Project structure
- there is no project structure, since the *Praktikum* does not have one

The relation between files here and their corresponding exercise sheet should be intuitive from the file names.

## Git

- **PLEASE USE PULL-REQUESTS SO THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE CHANCE TO REVIEW YOUR CODE!!!**
- I would suggest that we name our branches like that:
```
*name*/*name of exercise sheet*
```
- e.g.
```
marli/B1
```
